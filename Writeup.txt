In myMemTest, we allocated 20 pages, and then we accessed the pages in the order they were allocated.  We then accessed the pages in reverse order.  After that, we accessed the last 10 pages in ascending order, and then we accessed the last 10 pages in the same order.  Finally, we printed the first three bytes in each page as we incremented through the 20 pages.  The results of this test program show that the FIFO page replacement algorithm worked best when the reference pattern used the same set of pages throughout the whole program.  The LRU algorithm was very good when the reference pattern used a set of pages for a while and then the program needed to switch between different sets of pages.  RAND seemed to work best when pages were being accessed arbitrarily.
